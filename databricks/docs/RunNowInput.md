# RunNowInput

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**job_id** | Option<**i64**> | The ID of the job to be executed | [optional]
**idempotency_token** | Option<**String**> | An optional token to guarantee the idempotency of job run requests. If a run with the provided token already exists, the request does not create a new run but returns the ID of the existing run instead.  If you specify the idempotency token, upon failure you can retry until the request succeeds. Databricks guarantees that exactly one run is launched with that idempotency token.  This token must have at most 64 characters.  For more information, see [How to ensure idempotency for jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/jobs/jobs-idempotency). | [optional]
